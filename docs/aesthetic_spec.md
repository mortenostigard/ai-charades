# Aesthetic Specification

This document outlines the visual identity, mood, and "vibe" for **AI Charades: Director's Cut**. The goal is to create an experience that feels energetic, playful, and perfect for a social party setting.

## 1. Core Aesthetic Principles

- **Vibrant & Energetic**: The UI should feel alive and exciting.
- **Playful & Bold**: We are a party game, not a productivity app. Designs should be fun and confident.
- **High-Contrast & Dark Themed**: Optimized for readability and atmosphere in various social environments (e.g., a dimly lit room).
- **Touch-First & Uncluttered**: A clean interface with large, friendly shapes is paramount for mobile usability.

## 2. Color Palette

- **Theme**: Dark Mode First. Backgrounds should be deep, dark colors (e.g., dark purple, deep blue).
- **Primary Actions**: Use a single, vibrant, high-contrast color like **electric blue** or **hot pink** to draw attention to key buttons.
- **Accent Colors**: Use secondary vibrant colors (e.g., neon yellow, bright orange) for player highlights, timers, or notifications.
- **Feedback**:
  - **Success**: A bright, positive green.
  - **Warning/Timer**: A vivid, attention-grabbing yellow or orange.
  - **Sabotage/Error**: A distinct, energetic red.

## 3. Shape & Spacing

- **Shapes**: Prefer soft, rounded shapes. Use `rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl` for cards and buttons. Avoid sharp, 90-degree corners.
- **Layout**: Use a card-based layout to organize information. Cards should have a subtle border or drop-shadow to feel lifted from the background.
- **Spacing**: Be generous with padding and margins. The interface should feel spacious and breathe, never cramped.

## 4. Typography

- **Headings & Timers**: Use a **bold, chunky, sans-serif display font**. It should be playful but instantly legible. This is a key part of the game's personality.
- **Body & UI Text**: Use a clean, highly-readable sans-serif font
- **Hierarchy**: Maintain a clear and strong typographic scale. The most important information (like the prompt or the timer) should be the largest.

## 5. Animation & Effects

- **Micro-interactions**: Use subtle, bouncy animations on button presses to provide tactile feedback.
- **Notifications**: Sabotage deployments should trigger a quick, noticeable animation (e.g., a screen shake or flash).
- **Visual Polish**: Use glowing effects on key interactive elements to make them pop against the dark background.
