# AI Charades: Director's Cut - Game Specification

## Core Concept
Traditional charades with a twist: one player acts while another player (the Director) can deploy sabotage actions to make the performance more challenging and entertaining.

## Setup
- **Players**: 3-8 people
- **Devices**: Two phones (Actor + Director)
- **Roles**: Actor, Director, Audience (everyone else)
- **Rotation**: Strict clockwise rotation ensuring equal director turns

## Round Structure
- **Total Duration**: 90 seconds
- **Grace Period**: First 20 seconds, no sabotage allowed
- **Sabotage Window**: 70 seconds where Director can deploy constraints
- **Prompts**: Movies, songs, celebrities, books (expandable categories)

## Sabotage Mechanics
- **Maximum Sabotages**: 3 per round
- **Duration**: Each sabotage lasts 20 seconds
- **Stacking**: Multiple sabotages can be active simultaneously (compatible ones only)
- **Notification**: Actor receives sound + vibration when sabotage deployed

### Sabotage Types
**Movement Constraints:**
- "Hop on one foot"
- "Only use left hand"
- "Can't use right arm"
- "Stay in one spot"
- "Everything in slow motion"

**Timing Disruptions:**
- "Freeze for 10 seconds"
- "Act in reverse"
- "Speed up dramatically"

**Style Impositions:**
- "Act like you're underwater"
- "You're terrified of everything"
- "Act like a robot"
- "Pretend you're elderly"

## Scoring System (Risk/Reward)
### If Someone Guesses Correctly:
- **Actor**: +2 points
- **Director**: -1 point per sabotage used
- **Correct Guesser**: +1 point

### If No One Guesses:
- **Director**: +2 points (successful sabotage)
- **Actor**: 0 points
- **Everyone else**: 0 points

## Strategic Considerations
- **Director's Dilemma**: More sabotage increases chance of preventing guess (+2 points) but risks bigger penalty if someone still guesses (-3 points max)
- **Actor Challenge**: Must adapt performance to overcome constraints
- **Audience Engagement**: Balance between guessing quickly vs. watching entertainment unfold

## Victory Conditions
- **Casual Play**: No fixed endpoint, play until group wants to stop
- **Competitive Play**: First to 10 points or most points after equal director turns
- **Session Play**: 20-30 minutes with score tracking

## Special Rules
- **Sabotage Compatibility**: Only deploy sabotages that can work together
- **Honor System**: Group enforces that actors follow sabotage constraints
- **Director Timing**: Cannot deploy sabotage during active constraint countdown
- **Equal Opportunity**: Game tracks that everyone gets equal director turns

## Game Flow Summary
1. **Setup**: Assign Actor + Director, audience prepares to guess
2. **Grace Period**: Actor performs normally for 20 seconds
3. **Sabotage Phase**: Director can deploy constraints, Actor adapts
4. **Resolution**: Round ends on correct guess or 90-second timeout
5. **Scoring**: Points awarded based on outcome and sabotage usage
6. **Rotation**: Roles shift clockwise, repeat
