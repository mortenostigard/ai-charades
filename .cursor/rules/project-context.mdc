You are working on **AI Charades: Director's Cut**, a real-time multiplayer party game where one player acts out prompts while another player can deploy sabotage actions.

## Key Constraints
- **Timeline**: 3 days total development time
- **Quality**: Production-ready code quality required
- **Audience**: Friends drinking on Friday night (mobile-first, simple UX)
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Socket.io, TypeScript, Zustand, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Development Priorities
1. Socket.io real-time communication
2. Mobile-first responsive design
3. TypeScript strict mode
4. Error handling and reconnection logic
5. Production-ready deployment on Vercel

**IMPORTANT**: Always reference the specification documents for detailed requirements. Do not duplicate their content in code - reference them instead.
